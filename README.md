This theme improves upon Rainglow's Lavender (Contrast) theme, with a black terminal background, improved statusbar visibility when a workspace is open (black text on a lilac background), and better visual cues (statusbar with a white background and black text when no folder is open), etc. It is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and caters to the pastel-goth chick within me.

The theme is easy on the eyes, with a black background for the editor and bright pastel text highlighting.

It is also available for Hyper terminal.

This theme was inspired by [Rainglow](https://github.com/rainglow/vscode). This is the first theme I have ever created, and is a fork of Rainglow's Lavender (Contrast) theme.

The file icons used in the screenshot are from the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).

The font is [Fira-Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

If you'd like to report a bug with the theme, please raise an issue with the repository.
