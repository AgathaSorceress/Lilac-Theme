# Lilac

Lilac is a dark color theme with pretty pastel colours for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To show support for the project, you can do any (or many!) of the following:

- [Star the repository.](https://github.com/shubham-saudolla/Lilac-Theme)
- [Follow me on twitter, and say hi!](https://twitter.com/joyDivided13)
- [Follow me on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/s.phoenix99/)
- [Donate via PayPal.](https://paypal.me/shubhamsaudolla)

This theme was inspired by [https://github.com/rainglow/vscode](https://github.com/rainglow/vscode). This is the first theme I have ever created, and is a fork of Rainglow's Lavender (Contrast) theme.

If you'd like to report a bug with the theme, please raise an issue with the repository.

Shubham.
